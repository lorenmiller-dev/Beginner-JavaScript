Three technologies that create a website
    Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) - Create content/buttons/images
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - Changes appearence
    JavaScript - Makes website interactive

What is JavaScript?
    Giving instructions to a computer, computer follows instructions

Numbers
    follows order of operations

Variables
    container for storing data
    behaves if it was the value that it contains

    var - old way to declare variable, function lvl scope
        Accesible within entire function in which it is declared
        If declared outside of any function =  global variable
        

    let - provides block lvl scoping, limited to block (inside loop or if statement) 
        where they are defined. Not accesible outside of block

    const - declare constants, once value is assigned cannot be reassigned, also block lvl scope
        does not make value itself immutable

    1. declaration(var, let, const)
    2. assignment (= assignment operator)

Strings
    use alert(''); for a alert pop up

    'some' + 'text' + ... => output: 'sometext...'
    Concatenation: combining strings together
